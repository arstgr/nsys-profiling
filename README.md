# nsys-profiling

This repository contains instructions and scripts to profile AI and HPC workloads on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Overview

The repository provides tools and workflows for comprehensive profiling of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads running on NVIDIA GPUs. The profiling analysis covers both:

- **Communication**: Analysis of inter-process communication, data transfers, and synchronization
- **Computation**: Performance analysis of kernel execution and compute operations

## Tools

The repository includes:

- **Python scripts**: For detailed profiling data analysis and visualization
- **AWK scripts**: For efficient log parsing and data extraction

## Purpose

These profiling tools help identify performance bottlenecks, optimize GPU utilization, and improve the efficiency of AI and HPC applications running on NVIDIA hardware.
